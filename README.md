Web Server

## Introduction
This is a simple web server to serve the PHP and HTML files. It runs on `localhost:2728`, and it can identify the `index.php` files automatically. Also, it has a dashboard, and you can see the server details, developer contact, and server controlling switches in the dashboard. The dashboard runs on `localhost:2728/index.php`, or you can simply search `localhost:2728` and the server will automatically navigate to the dashboard.

Also, I created this server using [Python](https://github.com/DasunThathsara/Web-Server/tree/main/Python), C, and Java. You can choose the language and run the server file in that language. Then the server will start. After that, go to your browser and browse to localhost:2728` and go to your location.
