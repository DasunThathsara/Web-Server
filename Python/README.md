# Web Server using Python

## Introduction
This is a simple web server to serve the PHP and HTML files. It runs on `localhost:2728`, and it can identify the `index.php` files automatically. Also, it has a dashboard, and you can see the server details, developer contact, and server controlling switches in the dashboard. The dashboard runs on `localhost:2728/index.php`, or you can simply search `localhost:2728` and the server will automatically navigate to the dashboard.
<br><br>
Run server file to start the server file. Then the server will start. After that, go to your browser and browse to `localhost:2728` and go to your location. And save your files in the `htdocs` folder or create a folder in the `htdocs` folder and put your to that folder.
